# audio-playback-no-suppressions

A little html page that allows you to stream any input to any output of your choice, without any silly echo cancellation effects and that crap. This way you can listen to music and stuff from browser cast, without quality drops. 

## How to use

Just download the  html file and open it in your browser. Then select input/output and "Start Streaming". Then you can click "Cast to device" on your browser and voila.
